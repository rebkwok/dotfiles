dotfiles
========

My dotfiles. Not much to see here yet. Carry on...

Install with::

    curl https://raw.github.com/bedmondmark/dotfiles/master/setup/bootstrap.sh | bash

ToDo
----

* Automatic keygen, if necessary, and registration with github(?)
* Better backup of existing dotfiles (re-runs don't lose existing backups).
* Indempotent install/bootstrap scripts (unless deps have been updated).
